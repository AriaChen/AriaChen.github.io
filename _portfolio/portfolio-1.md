In 2023.05, as new players flocked to the Korean Minecraft server, **beartown.kr**, the server experienced a surge in activity. With **7,000 daily active players** and over **1500 concurrent players** at peak time during that period, in-game guides were inundated with questions every few seconds. Recognizing this overwhelming demand for information, we came to a conclusion that it would be ideal if a chatbot can automate responses to these frequently asked questions. 

## Development Journey

- **Rapid Design & Development**: From concept to implementation, I developed the chatbot in a weekend.
  
- **Collaborative Efforts**: With the incredible efforts of the players who crafted the FAQ dataset, and the dedication of the programming team, we launched the chatbot in a mere week.

**Check out the demo**:

## Impact

The chatbot has offered **real-time assistance** to players. Within just two to three months of its deployment,  it has addressed **over 100,000 questions**, enhancing the user experience significantly.

## Reflection

I'm proud of the rapid development and success of this project, and it stands as a testament to the team and community's commitment to improving the gaming experience for all. The future holds endless possibilities, and I am thrilled to explore more innovations in the gaming domain.
