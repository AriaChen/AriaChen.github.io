During my tenure from 2022 to 2023 at GeoSystem Research Corporation, I dived into new territories, undertaking a project that bridge the computer science technology with oceanographic research. Here are the key accomplishments and tools practiced:

- **Languages & Libraries**: Leveraged `C++`, `C#`, and the `OpenCV` library, crafting a stereo vision system.
  
- **Fieldwork**: Conducted fieldwork for image data collection, overcoming difficulties of data processing under real-world scenarios.

- **Data Analysis**: Employed `Python` to perform advanced data analysis, enhancing the depth and accuracy of ocean wave data analysis.

This initiative allowed me to practice my knowledge in computer science and  facilitated its application across diverse domains. It's been an honor to contribute to the oceanographic field with my ability.

**Note**: Due to the confidential nature of the project, I am unable to share specific details or insights beyond what is presented here.
