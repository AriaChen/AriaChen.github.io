Hello, I am Xinyuan Chen. My passion lies at the intersection of computer science, machine learning, natural language processing, and their tangible impact on real-world scenarios. I am originally from China, lived in the UK, and am currently residing in South Korea.

I'm proud to have earned bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from both the [Communication University of China](https://en.cuc.edu.cn/) and the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). I further completed an MSc degree in Advanced Computing from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). There, my research delved into probing Transformer-based models for machine translation quality estimation.

I worked at [GeoSystem Research Corporation](https://www.geosr.com/) in South Korea, where I combined computer vision technology with ocean science research. This role showcased my ability to dive into new areas and handle both hardware and software tasks. During this time, I also developed proficiency in the Korean language.

I am skilled in Python, C, C++, C#, and familiar with frameworks like Pytorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. I'm eager to take on further challenges in AI, especially NLP, and software development.

With fluency in Chinese, English, and Korean, I'm well-suited for multicultural environments.

If you're as excited about technology and its potential as I am, or if you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out!
